Rough PCB designs for our robot hand project, this is a work in progress being developed in altium designer

There is an analog PCB that contains a motor driver, barrel jack power supply, a header to connect to the motor, and a header to connect to the digital PCB.

The digital PCB contains an ESP 32 microcontroller, a rotory encoder decoder chip as well as a multiplexer to reduce the number of GPIO pins needed, a TRS jack to output state signals, and it contains a pin header to connect to an ultrasonic distance sensor
