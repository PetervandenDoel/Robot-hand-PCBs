Rough PCB designs for our robot hand project, this is a work in progress being developed in altium designer

There is an analog PCB that contains a motor driver, power supply, a header to connect to the motor, and a header to connect to the digital PCB.

the digital PCB contains an ESP 32 microcontroller a motor decoder chip as well as a multiplexer to reduce the number of pins needed and it contains a pin header
to connect to an ultrasound sensor
